    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a basic italian recipe that requires few ingredients and fewer steps to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Boil water in a large pot.</li>
       <li>While waiting for water to boil, slice garlic in thin sheets.</li>
       <li>Separate parsley leaves from the stalks. Finely chop the leaves without crushing while cutting the stalks into very short pieces.</li>
       <li>When the water is boiling or close to boiling, add salt; a handful or two depending on the size of pot.</li>
       <li>Allow the water to boil for 1 minute before adding the Spaghetti. Boil the sphagetti for 1 minute less than what is recommended on the package.</li>
       <li>In a pan, heat the olive oil on lowest setting for 1-2 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add sliced garlic and parsley stalks.</li>
       <li>Turn off the fire when the garlic starts to brown. Wait for the Sphagetti to cook.</li>
       <li>Transfer the sphagetti from the pot directly to the pan. Mix it well with the oil.</li>
       <li>Add two and a half cup of pasta water from the pot into the pan.</li>
       <li>Turn on the fire and set it to medium.</li>
       <li>Add the parsley leaves and red pepper flakes while continually mixing the spaghetti and oil.</li>
       <li>Once the pasta water and oil mixture thickens, turn off the fire. Continue mixing until all water is absorbed and the sauce is mostly oil.</li>
       <li>Transfer to a bowl or tray.</li>
    </ol>
